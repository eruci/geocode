# geocode
Geocode - The Geolocation Code mapping latitude,longitude to a single alphanumeric string.

##Abstract
Geocode is a one-dimensional location code that acheives several improvements over similar systems, it is shorter (up to 11 bytes), has higher accuracy (up to 1 meter) and avoids the borderline discontinuities of other single dimensional location codes. 

##Motivation
There have been many attempts to map 2 and 3 dimensional location coordinates expresses as latitude,longitude,elevation into one dimensional alphanumeric strings.
